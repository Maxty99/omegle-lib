# Omegle-lib

_A crate for interfacing with Omegle_

---

![Build](https://github.com/maxty99/omegle-lib/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

I wrote this crate for my [Icymegle](https://github.com/Maxty99/Icymegle)
project since there wasn't really any other library that was being actively
maintained. This crate might also get out of date eventually when Omegle updates
their protocol, but I will try to keep it miantained as best I can.

# Maturity

This library is in basic working order but just because Omegle can change how it
works at any point there are bound to be breaking changes introduced every so
often, so use this crate with that in mind

# How to use

Check out the example for some basic usage or chack out my
[Icymegle](https://github.com/Maxty99/Icymegle) client for a more advanced
implementation.

# Contributing

PRs welcome, especially if Omegle decided to change something with the way the
chat works. Even if you don't know anything about what changed, if you
consistently get an error from Omegle just write an Issue and I'll look into it.

# Thanks

Most of the initial knowledge about how Omegle's protocol worked I got from this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/nucular/e19264af8d7fc8a26ece). Also, before
starting this project I was using the
[omegalul-rs](https://crates.io/crates/omegalul) crate.
